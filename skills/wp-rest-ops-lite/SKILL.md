<!-- RAINMOJO_CLIENT_WORKSPACE_ROUTING_V1 -->
## Client workspace routing (mandatory for file changes)

Every generated file has exactly one home. Audit, keyword and comparison
outputs live under `work/{domain}/` created by `new-workspace-lite`
(`00-baseline/` first run, `01-current/` later runs, `02-fixes/`, `03-content/`,
`04-reports/`, `uploads/` read-only for user files); never invent another
top-level folder there. Content production and WordPress publishing use the
client workspace `clients/<client>/` created by `new-client-lite`: read
`workspace-routing.json` first, resolve every artifact with
`{PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rainmojo-so-lite/scripts/client_workspace.py route`, use the
most precise registered route, edit root files only when their exact filename is
in `root_policy.allowed_files`, treat `uploads/` as read-only, and when no route
fits use `create-work` then `route-work`; never construct a `work/<name>/...`
path by hand inside a client workspace. Never write generated files to the
plugin tree or the caller's working directory. Append one line to the
workspace's `CHANGELOG.md` or `log.md` after every write. Run
`client_workspace.py validate` before handing a client workspace over. Direct
CMS/API operations retain their own safety and verification gates.

<!-- RAINMOJO_PRESENTATION_LAYER_V1 -->
## Presentation (Two-Tier, 7 modes)

Answer in the response mode that matches the request
(`{PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rainmojo-so-lite/_base/presentation-scaffold.md`): quick fact,
how-to, comparison, troubleshoot, audit, deployable, always closing with next
steps. A run that writes a deliverable ends with a Tier 1 card built from
`summary.json` (`templates/widget/summary.schema.json`) and rendered with
`{PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rainmojo-so-lite/scripts/present.py --target auto`, then hands
off to the Tier 2 file, which stays complete and unchanged. Lite cards carry
counts of checks passed, never a weighted score. Every card value is copied
from the deliverable; unmeasured values show as could not verify. No emoji on
any surface; the glyph allowlist applies to chat and Markdown only.


# WordPress REST API Operations

Reference skill for all WP REST bulk operations. See `references/powershell-scripts.md` for ready-to-run scripts.

For new content packages, media uploads, featured images, inline image binding,
and verified draft creation, use `wp-content-publisher-lite`. This skill remains the
low-level remediation reference.

## Authentication

### Standard (no WAF)
```python
from base64 import b64encode
token = b64encode(f"{WP_USER}:{WP_APP_PASS}".encode()).decode()
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Basic {token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
```

### Standard REST route fallback

Authenticated clients should first try `/wp-json/wp/v2/*`. When that route
returns an explicit WAF 403, retry the same request through WordPress's standard
`/?rest_route=/wp/v2/*` route and lock the session to the successful route.

Never retry a timed-out or otherwise ambiguous write.

### Legacy Cloudflare query-token workaround

Use only when both standard WordPress REST routes are unavailable and the site
owner explicitly approves a temporary query-token workaround. Prefer WAF rules,
Application Passwords, and `rest_route`; query tokens can leak through logs and
must be removed after the operation.

```php
add_filter('determine_current_user', function($user) {
    if (!empty($_GET['t']) && $_GET['t'] === 'YOUR_TOKEN') {
        $u = get_user_by('login', 'your-wp-username');
        if ($u) return $u->ID;
    }
    return $user;
}, 20);
add_filter('rest_authentication_errors', function($errors) {
    if (!empty($_GET['t']) && $_GET['t'] === 'YOUR_TOKEN') { return null; }
    return $errors;
}, 20);
```
Append `?t=YOUR_TOKEN` to every REST URL. **Deactivate snippet after all phases complete.**

## Rate limiting
- `time.sleep(25)` between every POST mandatory even with CF Skip rules
- Batches 50+: use background subprocess to avoid 300s MCP timeout

## Key endpoints

| Operation | Endpoint | Method |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Auth test | `/wp-json/wp/v2/users/me` | GET |
| All posts | `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?per_page=100&page=N&status=any&context=edit` | GET |
| All pages | `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages?per_page=100&page=N&status=any&context=edit` | GET |
| Single post | `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{id}?context=edit` | GET |
| Update | `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{id}` | POST |
| Yoast canonical | POST with `{"meta":{"yoast_wpseo_canonical":"URL"}}` | POST |
| Redirection plugin | `/wp-json/redirection/v1/redirect` | POST |

## CRITICAL: batch fetch bug
**Never** read `content.raw` from a batch list endpoint it concatenates content across posts.
Always fetch individually: `GET /posts/{id}?context=edit`

## Elementor constraint
Elementor pages have empty `content.raw` via REST. Flag as `MANUAL` edit via WP Admin only.

## Error codes

| Code | Cause | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 401 | Auth failed | Check Application Password; enable WPCode snippet |
| 403 | Cloudflare WAF | Retry through `/?rest_route=` first (see Authentication); legacy query-token snippet only with the site owner's explicit approval |
| 404 | Wrong post type | Check backup CSV for type (post vs page) |
| 429 | Rate limit | Increase sleep to 30s |
| 522 | CF timeout | Retry once after 60s |
| 400 | Bad JSON | Add `-Depth 2 -Compress` to ConvertTo-Json |
